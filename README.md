# ANTH 641 Week 6_3

Differently than early in-class activities, there is no specific markdown file providing instructions on your Week 6_3 exercise. Make sure to fork this repo and set up your own mybinder.org environment to run the Jupyter notebooks - copy the binder link and replace the one below. When you launch your binder open the notebook called __ANTH 641_Week 6-Exercise-3__. You'll complete the exercise right in that notebook and download it with the name YOURNAME_Week-6_Exercise-3 and put it into your forked repo. The notebook was adapted from the original PAS API notebook by Daniel Pett.

This binder is preloaded with R, ggplot, Rcurl, ggplot, jsonlite, and the [archdata](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/archdata/archdata.pdf) package. It also has a table from [Graham 2016](https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:18909/) to demonstrate how to read in a csv file. Use this notebook as a starting point for learning some statistical analysis of archaeological data. See also [Marwick 2018 CRAN Taskview: Archaeological Science](https://github.com/benmarwick/ctv-archaeology/).

It also contains a notebook showing how to retrieve information from the [Portable Antiquities Scheme](http://finds.org.uk) database, which could also be analyzed in particular ways. This notebook is in two parts; the first shows how to transform the json search results into a csv. The second uses that data to find the filepaths to download images of the objects into nicely sorted folders. The script is courtesy of Dan Pett, formerly of the PAS and now with the [Fitzwilliam Museum](fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk). Thank you Dan!
